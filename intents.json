  "responses": ["Infrastructure: VIT campus is spread across a vast area of 372 acres. The remarkable aspect of VIT is the state-of-the-art infrastructure provided for both students and faculty. Fully furnished and well-equipped labs decorate every building in the University.  Moreover, the campus is fortified with ample features that support diverse events - Auditoriums, plush open spaces, outdoor stages and much more.\n Academic Blocks: A striking feature of VIT is the well-planned and comprehensive premises provided for both students and faculty. There are seven academic blocks in VIT which are extremely specialised in their own particular field, namely- MB, GDN, CDMM, SMV, CBMR, TT, SJT and GANDHI BLOCK. The layout has been excellently planned to make the maximum utilisation of the 372 acre campus. The idea behind these separate blocks is to make every block equipped with the necessary amenities whilst providing the perfect atmosphere for both studies and research.\n1. Dr.MGR Block\n2. Silver Jubilee Tower\n3. Technology Tower\n4. Sri.M. Vishweshwarariah Building\n5. CBMR\n6. G.D Naidu Block\n 7. CDMM Building\n 8. A.L. Mudallar Block\n9. Gandhi Block\n\n Auditoriams and Conference Facilities: Our University firmly believes in providing its students exposure to national and international knowledge experts, through regular national and international conferences / symposia and workshops hosted on campus. It is with this view that a wide choice of modern conference facilities have been meticulously planned and incorporated into the VIT campus. ‘Anna Audi ‘ commonly used by students is nothing short of being a marvel. Able to accommodate 1800 students and spread over an area of 15436 sq. feet , it has been built with centralised air conditioners , Wi-fi service and a spectacular stage along with green rooms and perfect amount of lighting. This auditorium is used for various events and conferences. It is located beside the volleyball and basketball courts and serves as a landmark in VIT. Anna Auditorium (Seating capacity – 1800). Dr. M. Channa Reddy Auditorium (Seating capacity – 469). Dr. Ambedkar Auditorium (Seating capacity – 198). Kamaraj Auditorium (Seating capacity – 128). Multi-purpose Hall (at Gandhi block) (Seating capacity –462 ) \n\n IT Infrastructure: Centre for Technical Support (CTS) maintains the policies governing the use of VIT computing and IT communication resources. The IT Policy applies to the resources administered by the administrative departments such as Library, Computer Laboratories, Offices of the Institution, Hostels and Guest houses wherever the network facility was provided by the Institution. Further, all the faculty, students, staff, departments, authorized visitors/visiting faculty and others who may be granted permission to use the IT Infrastructure, and must comply with the guidelines. Certain violations of IT policy laid down by VIT by any institution member may even result in disciplinary action against the offender by the institution authorities.\n\n Sports Facilities: To achieve a healthier lifestyle while coping with the pressures of studying, one needs to be healthy both emotionally and physically. With this motto, VIT emphasizes the importance of sports and considers them as an integral part of the curriculum. VIT has a number of centres for physical education and sports activities that help the students maintain fitness and develop a competitive spirit. Its numerous outdoor playgrounds and indoor courts are spread over a 20-acre area.\n\n Canteen: VIT has been amply blessed with three fully equipped multi cuisine canteens present at three strategic locations in college. Two at the far ends of college, one each in G D Naidu Block and the Silver Jubilee Tower and one more at the centre of the college near the Technology Tower. All the three canteens are on contract basis with external caterers and provide quality food at student friendly prices. Hosting a wide array of cuisines and dishes, they cater to the needs of the students from every corner of country providing them home style food with no compromise on the quality.\n\n Smart Classrooms: The smart classrooms are well designed to incorporate everything needed for a pleasant learning atmosphere. The wide spacious classrooms contain a white board and a projector that is used for teaching. As a result professors can switch to different modes of teaching as and when required so that the teaching isn’t monotonous and the lectures are put across in the best way possible. This hi-tech equipment enables the faculty to conduct classes in a way that enable students to make use of every available resource at the click of a button. These classrooms are also often used for seminars and events from time to time.\n "]
